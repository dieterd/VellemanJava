Java API to access Velleman Edu boards

To have this API to work: 

 1. Download and install JNA from https://github.com/twall/jna
 2. Create a jar from the EDUxx.DLL using the proper platform directory, go to directory where the EDUxx.DLL is located , example for Win32-64 bit
  
```
    mkdir win32-x86-64
      
    copy EDU*.DLL win32-x86-64
      
    jar cvf EDU.jar win32-x86-64 
```
  
 3. your classpath should be : jna.jar , jna-platform.jar and EDU.jar 
 4. connect the EDU board and run the EDUxxDemo. eg.

```
    java -classpath jna.jar;jna-platform.jar;EDU.jar com.deramoudt.velleman.edu05.Edu05Demo
```
Warning : as the EDUxx.DLL is 32-bit, you should only use a 32 bit Java VM to run this, even on 64 bit Windows.
